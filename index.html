          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
          Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
          control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
          for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
          for example:
        </p>
        <div class="syntax">
          <p>
            function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section">
        <header id="JavaScript">JavaScript</header>
        <p>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
          client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
          HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
          and page navigation.
        </p>
        <div class="syntax">
          <p>
            if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
            defined
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
          extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
          provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
          the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
        </p>
        <div class="syntax">
          <p>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</p>
        </div>
      </section>

        <p>
          In computer programming, a global variable is a variable with global
          scope, meaning that it is visible (hence accessible) throughout the
          program, unless shadowed. The set of all global variables is known as
          the global environment or global state.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.
          Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of these variables.
          Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from
          outside the function.

        <p>Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.</p>
        <p>
          You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where
          you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in
          another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be
          expressed this way as a loop:
        </p>
        <div class="syntax">
          <p>
            for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) { // Runs 5 times, with values
            of step 0 through 4. console.log('Walking east one step'); }
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do
          the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that
          it's possible that number could be zero!)
        </p>
        <p>
          The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the
          start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that
          are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.
        </p>
        <p>The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>for statement</li>
          <li>do...while statement</li>
          <li>while statement</li>
          <li>labeled statement</li>
          <li>break statement</li>
          <li>continue statement</li>
          <li>for...in statement</li>
        </ul>

          Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A
          function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements
          that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to
          qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output
          where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the
          output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope
          from which you wish to call it.
